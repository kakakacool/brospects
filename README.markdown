This repository is a mixed bag of Bro scripts that are too specific to be
included in the official [Bro scripts
repository](http://git.bro-ids.org/bro-scripts.git). The scripts are
of expirimental nature and might have a few edges, so you are welcome to ping
me for feedback and clarifications.

Please see the file `COPYING` for the licence details.
